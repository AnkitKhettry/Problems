# Lifecycle of a Spark Application

## 1. Application Submission
- **Stage**: SUBMITTED
- **Description**: The application is submitted to a cluster manager (like YARN, Mesos, or Spark's standalone cluster manager). This is where you define the main class of your application, its resources (like memory and CPU cores), and any other necessary configuration.

## 2. Resource Allocation
- **Stages**: PENDING, ACCEPTED
- **Description**: 
  - PENDING: The application is waiting for available resources. 
  - ACCEPTED: The cluster manager has allocated resources, and the application is waiting to start. 

## 3. Application Initialization
- **Stage**: INITIALIZING
- **Description**: SparkContext is initialized. This is the heart of a Spark application, establishing a connection to the Spark execution environment.

## 4. Job Execution
- **Stage**: RUNNING
- **Description**: 
  - The application runs the main function and executes jobs. 
  - Jobs are divided into stages based on the transformations and actions in your code. 
  - Each stage consists of tasks based on data partitioning.

## 5. Transformation and Actions
- **Transformation**: Transformations (like `map`, `filter`, `reduceByKey`) are lazy operations that define a new RDD. They are only executed when an action is called.
- **Actions**: Actions (like `collect`, `count`, `saveAsTextFile`) trigger the execution of the transformations that were defined earlier.

## 6. Shuffling and Stages
- **Description**: Shuffling data (redistributing data across different executors and machines) may occur when certain types of transformations are applied (e.g., `reduceByKey`). Shuffling is an expensive operation and marks the boundary between different stages.

## 7. Task Execution
- **Description**: Individual tasks are executed on Spark executors, which are JVM processes. Tasks are the smallest unit of work in a Spark job and correspond to processing a single partition of data.

## 8. Completion
- **Stage**: FINISHED
- **Description**: The application completes its execution. SparkContext is stopped, and resources are released back to the cluster manager.

## 9. Error States
- **Stages**: FAILED, KILLED
- **Description**: 
  - FAILED: The application failed due to an error during execution.
  - KILLED: The application was terminated either by the user or the cluster manager due to resource constraints or other policies.
